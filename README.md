# VROCC (Veronica Robles Cultural Center) 
VROCC is a non-profit organization located in East Boston, that promotes Latin American cultures to facilitate economic growth, stronger communities; to inspire and encourage community action for racial and social equity.

VROCC would like to have their website updated, so HTML5/CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, and Bootstrap are being implemented to create a new website for them.
